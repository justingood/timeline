This is just a simple flask project to hook into when you want to record the start/stop times of something. It leverages [Google's Charts library](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/timeline) to render the output.

I've used this primarily to get a better understanding of a CI system's timings and how to better parallise things, so it's opinionated in that direction.

The result looks something like this:
